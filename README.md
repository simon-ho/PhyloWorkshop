# PhyloWorkshop
This repository contains a number of practical exercises in molecular phlyogenetics. The exercises involve the use of the software MEGA, MrBayes, and BEAST. These are all freely available from their developers. 

These practical exercises have been presented as part of introductory and advanced workshops on phylogenetic analysis, organised by members of the Molecular Ecology, Evolution, and Phylogenetics laboratory at the University of Sydney. Further details of these workshops can be found here:
